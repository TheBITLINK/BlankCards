# BlankCards
Another Card Agaisnt Humanity clone. Inspired from pretendyoure.xyz

Powered by Node.js, Semantic UI and Socket.io

It's still a Work in progress, so expect bugs and updates!

## Basic Configuration

You'll need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't

First, run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.

After doing that, edit **BlankCards.json** and configure the server
(You may also want to edit the "update password" in /routes/index.js)

At the moment, there are only 2 locales (en-us and es-es)
If you want to make a translation, fell free to make a pull request!

After editing the settings, run the server with `npm start`

I recommend using nodemon or forever to run the server if you pretend to keep it online 24/7, as the current version is an alpha and it will likely crash

### Importing Card Decks from CardCast

When creating a new room, you can import card decks from CardCast by typing CC:<id> in the search field.

### Server list

<W.I.P>

If you want your server to appear on the list, reach me out and i'll give you a subdomain and put it on this list.

More info coming soon (i'll try to explain everything later, in the wiki)
